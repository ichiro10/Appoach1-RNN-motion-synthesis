# Appoach1-RNN-motion-synthesis

In this project, we are aiming for  identifing which aspects of the character animation affect the userâ€™s perception and interaction with the character (agent). Therefore we applied a Variational Autoencoder to an RNN motion prediction system taken from the work of Julieta Martinez. The purpose is to see if adding an VAE could help the model to predict motions in a specific style. 

## Attribution

The core code used in this project was created by Julieta Martinez et al. [Link-to-original-code-repo](https://github.com/una-dinosauria/). Their paper can be found 
[Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02445.pdf).

## Modifications and Use Case

I have adapted the original code to suit the requirements of my use case. The modifications include adding a VAE to the system . This adaptation allows the code to effectively address the unique needs of making the model predict motion with a specfic style.

## How to Use
Please refer to the guide lines in [Link-to-original-code-repo](https://github.com/una-dinosauria/)

I would like to express my gratitude to Martinez et al. for creating the initial codebase. Their contribution laid the groundwork for the enhancements made in this project.
